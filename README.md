<h2 align="center"> Overview of the project ðŸ—»</h2>

<h3 align="center"> Messages Page </h3>
<p align="center">
This is where users will be most active. Reading the anonymous messages that other users had sent them. 
it shows the recieved messages in chronological order based on their date recieved.
</p>

<h3 align="center"> Profile Page </h3>
<p align="center">
Contains the profile of the user, with their fullname & profile picture. With an option to update their profile information.
the url of this page is set by the user so they can set a custom url that points to their profile so they can share it with friends. it can be set at registeration or when editing your profile.
</p>

<h3 align="center"> Register Page </h3>
<p align="center">
This is where users first register on the website, if they'd like to recieve messages. As sending messages can be done without registeration.
they are asked for their fullname , email , password and if they'd like to set a custom profile url. (if not given the profile url is generated randomly and is guaranteed to be unique)
</p>

<h3 align="center"> Loign Page </h3>
<p align="center">
This page is pretty self explanatory as it allows registered users to login into the website.
 it assigns them a cookie at login which lasts about 20 minutes.
